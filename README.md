# SessionID Chrome Extension
Chrome Extension I made at work to quickly grab the Django sessionID from the cookie in your browser.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and toggle 
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you just cloned.

## Usage
1. Log in to your Django app
2. Click the extension button in the tab to copy the `sessionid` to your clipboard.
